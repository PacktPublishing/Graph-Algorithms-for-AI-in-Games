# Graph Algorithms for AI in Games [Video]
This is the code repository for [Graph Algorithms for AI in Games [Video]](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/graph-algorithms-ai-games-video?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781788472180), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
Graphs arise in various real-world situations as there are road networks, computer networks and, most recently, social networks! If you're looking for the fastest time to get to work, cheapest way to connect a set of computers into a network you will need algorithms on graphs. 

For using the efficient algorithm to automatically find communities and opinion leaders on Facebook, you're going to work with graphs and algorithms on graphs. This course will serve as an introduction to graphs and present their increasingly complex algorithms that work on graphs. In the course, you will start by understanding how graphs can be used in games to represent various states and how searching graphs can help us. The course will introduce you to pathfinding, which is one of the most commonly solved problems in game AI. The course will then show you how to Optimize the pathfinding. 

Finally, at the end of the course, you will learn the concept of meta-heuristics which can be used to find general solutions in complex domains.
